We look more closely at a Jamboree poster.

```poster
Come one, come all, to the greatest celebration of the year:

THE WOLF'S HEAD JAMBOREE!

Attendance and children required.
Pikes will be provided.

ALL WILL BE WELL!

```

Banhammer asks a passer-by about the people in the stocks. She carefully answers "They're in the stocks for committing malicious unhappiness." She looks around and noticing no guards near, she adds: "Those who go against the Baron are branded as being in league with the Devil. The luckier ones get the stocks.." and then she hurries off.

A group of guards, led by a grim looking axeman who we later learn is Izek Strazni, arrive in the square, plastering new posters over the top of the Jamboree posters. They read:

```poster
COME ONE, COME ALL, to the greatest celebration of the year:

THE FESTIVAL OF THE BLAZING SUN!

Attendance and children required.
Rain or shine.

ALL WILL BE WELL!

```

Aryn and Charity want to look in at the inn to gather information. On the way there we see a grimy toy shop with a bee on either side of its hanging shingle. In the stained glass windows placards read: "Is no fun, is no Blinsky!"

We approach the two-story inn. It's a little dilapidated, like everything in Borovia. Inside, there are wolf heads on the walls, smoky lamps, and a couple of balconies overlooking the high-ceilinged main area.

It's before midday and the taproom is quiet. We spot someone who can only be Rictavio. He looks like Neil Patrick Harris's character from *A Series of Unfortunate Events*. Aryn squeezes in alongside probably-Rictavio and orders two drinks from the barkeep, Danica Martikov (featured in a couple of Martikov family portraits hanging in the bar).

Aryn selects an expensive Red Dragon Crush wine; Danica has to uncork a fresh bottle, and there's a little jet of flame as the cork comes out. Aryn's pretty sure the magic is a property of the bottle rather than the wine itself.

Ric accepts the wine with grace and Aryn asks him about his wagon. He needs little invitation to start a chain of stories about his time in the carnivale, and carries the Dragon wine bottle over to a table as he lists some stories he could tell.

----

**The Tale of the Three-Headed Weregoat of Kartakas**
 
Ah, but you've never known terror until you've stared into _three_ pairs of goat eyes — all glowing red, all full of moon-mad hunger! I was performing in the hills of Kartakas, a land where the beasts sing better than the bards, when a humble shepherd came to me, weeping. His flock? Gone. His wife? Fled. His remaining goat? Singing opera and chewing silver. That’s when I knew… lycanthropy! I tracked the creature through the gorges, armed only with a whip, a mirror, and a rather judgmental chicken. When I found it, it charged me thrice—once with each head! But I danced between its hooves, slapped it across the snout with my silver mirror, and banished the beast with a well-timed high C. I tell you, if I hadn't cracked its curse with the power of performance, I'd be chewing cud to this day.

----

After this story Charity sits down at the table; Ric gestures for another Dragon bottle from Danica, but Charity points Danica at the cheaper bottles instead.

Banhammer and Thalion come and sit, and Banhammer asks for the Lich story he'd mentioned earlier.

----

**The Time I Juggled Fire Skulls for the Lich Queen of Darkon**

It was a dreadful little job — the Lich Queen of Darkon, sour-faced and colder than the grave, demanded entertainment lest she _‘turn me into a decorative wight.’_ Naturally, I said yes! My carnival caravan had long since scattered, my fire-breather lost to a swamp hag’s bet, and my juggler eaten by a mimic disguised as a juggling pin. So what’s a ringmaster to do? Improvise! I bartered with some local necromancers for three disembodied skulls, stuffed their eye sockets with pitch-soaked rags, and spun those flaming boneheads into a whirlwind of death-defying dazzle! The Queen laughed so hard she cracked her phylactery—_slightly_, mind you—and let me leave with my organs intact. Quite a compliment from royalty.

----

Charity catches Thalion's eye and says "This guy cracked into a Queen's phylactery", leaning heavy on the euphemism. Ric catches the implied disbelief but pushes on nonetheless.

Ric seems like he would start his third story when the door bangs open and a miasma of sweaty leather and musk scent enters, swirling around a barrel-chested incarnation of Gaston, carrying a wolf corpse. He dumps the corpse onto the bar and announces "Here's another wolf that you need never fear again!"

Breathless admiration from a cluster of patrons puffs up Gastonovich's already massive ego. Rictavio says under his breath, "now *here's* a guy who tells a lot of fake stories."

Gastonovich enjoys the admiration of the simping crowd. We notice a couple of guys in a corner scowling at the performance. Aryn and Charity exchange a look, and Aryn nominated herself to investigate, sliding out of her chair to go and talk to the grumps as Charity asks Ric about the mummy story.

----

**The Dancing Mummies of Har’Akir**
 
In the golden deserts of Har’Akir — ah, I remember it well, mostly because sand _does not_ come out of silk — I found myself caught between a caravan of tomb robbers and the wrath of a high priest who had recently been embalmed… poorly. When the sun set, the dunes trembled and out came _the dancing mummies_. No really, they danced — a sacred funerary rite meant to ferry souls into the afterlife, or so I was told mid-chase. Trapped and outnumbered, I did what any bard worth his boots would do: I joined in. I mimicked their sacred steps, whirled in perfect time, and before I knew it, I was crowned 'Honorary Corpse-Warden of the Fifth Chamber.' They let me leave the tomb alive… though they did curse me with spontaneous sand in my shoes for the next seven years.

----

Ric demonstrates by dramatically removing a shoe and pouring a little sand onto the floor.

Meanwhile Aryn sits at the two guys' table and asks if they're not fans of Gastonovitch. They explain that he's high bluster and low skill, and his only motivation is to --  mostly metaphorically -- get his dick sucked by everyone in the town. Part of their disdain is that they're noble scions while he's a low-born commoner. These guys are from the Wachter family, descendants of Fiona Wachter who they claim is the one of the few remaining pure and true nobles.

Aryn plans a stealth cropdust as she exits, but doesn't manage it and unconvincingly blames her bagpipes.

Rictavio notices that it's approaching lunchtime and apologises as he leaves, collecting food from Danica that he says he needs to deliver to his destitute toymaker friend.

We decide against following him, and Banhammer steams up to Gastonovitch. "As a brave adventurer, you must be familiar with the area. Have you heard of an abbey to the west?"

Big G points at the direwolf corpse and claims "Ha ha! This is what I'm concerned with, not mapping out where every little abbey is!"  Banhammer says "No worries, good luck showing those wolves who the true alpha is." and steps away, but Danica beckons him to the bar and tells him about how they used to get monks from an abbey coming into town on supply runs, but they've not been seen for a couple of tendays. She recommends talking to Father Lucien at St Andral's Church for more info. And if we're headed west, she asks for help with a wine delivery that hasn't arrived -- if we could stop in at the winery and get that delivery sorted, she'd be able to pay us for the service.

Banhammer agrees and Danica sends her husband Irwin Martikov to join us at the table. Irwin doesn't know the abbey but describes how to get to the winery, and gives us a rough map.

The Martikovs shout us lunch, and we decide to go visit the toyshop and then the church.

The toyshop is open but unattended. We look at some toys. There's a sort of merry-go-round with wolves chasing children in a circle; there's a mobile of bats on strings.

The toymaker waddles in, a monkey sitting on his shoulder, and spruiks up his wares with a practiced patter. Thanks to her fancy upbringing, Charity recognises iambic pentameter when she hears it.

He notices us looking at some toys and shows us a tiny gallows with an operational trap door and a tiny man to be hanged. He also shows us a tiny doll with a bunch of creepy interchangeable heads, including one head with its eyes and mouth stitched shut. He also shows us a ventriloquist dummy that looks like Strahd. He makes the dummy speak, "Ah I'm in charge of everyone! Ha ha!"

He pulls out a wooden doll of a child, and pops open the doll to reveal another smaller doll. Each nested doll is older looking, and the final smallest doll is a mummified corpse.

Thalion and Banhammer notice another doll behind the counter that looks weirdly like Ireena. Banhammer calls it out; Blinsky notices our real live Ireena and look surprised. "Special order, not for sale! Not for sale!"

Charity asks Blinsky to maybe not tell anyone that Ireena was here. He seems puzzled but agrees to keep the secret. He whispers to his monkey Piccolo that he should hide the Ireena doll away.

Aryn is interested in the many-headed doll. She asks for heads that look like people knows, seven heads in total including a Strahd head. He seems to misunderstand persistently about the Strahd head and eventually Aryn asks for no Strahd head and two blank heads and pays the 35 copper price, for pickup the day after the festival.

> A: acquires ownership of a custom multi headed doll, to be delivered in four days
 
Charity asks Blinsky about Rictavio; he says he's a good friend to Piccolo and to Blinsky. We press a little and we end up with the sense that Rictavio didn't come back here with the lunch he took from the inn.

We want to find out more but can't work out how to dig any deeper. We give Blinsky some cheerful goodbyes and head to St Andral's church (via the inn, because that's where our directions start from).

The church has some broken stained glass windows and a misty graveyard surrounded with an iron fence, and a brawny young fellow digging a grave therein. Banhammer checks the door, which is shut, and calls out to the gravedigger. He seems a little annoyed by the interruption.

Banhammer: "Just looking for Fr Lucien."

Gravedigger: "What, are you new here? He'll be in the church, doing the midday service."

B, muttering: "Well I hope your god is okay with snooty little bitches."

G: "Just as okay as he is with ignorant rubes!"

Banhammer leads us into the church, moving as quietly as we can. Inside, the sanctuary is packed with anxious townsfolk listening to today's sermon. Father Lucien is lecturing about the protection of St Andral against the dark night and the creeping dread. A young altar boy is moving through the crowd with a collection plate.

Soon, the sermon wraps up and people shuffle out. Lucien notices us waiting, and greets us pleasantly. Banhammer asks after the Abbey of St Markovia; Lucien asks why.

We tell him of Strahd's obsession with Ireena. Lucien has heard of Ireena; we find it a bit creepy that people here are so familiar with the story. He's not sure if the abbey can provide the safety we seek, and the abbey itself has not been heard from for a while. He looks around to confirm that all the parishioners have left, and confesses that recently the holy relics of St Andral has recently been stolen, and he fears for the sanctity of the church without it.

We run through the current situation. We know that the church would be *more* protected if we could recover the stolen relics, but Ireena sheltering here would still be vulnerable to pro-Strahd factions in town. The abbey has some unknown issue but if we were able to restore it, it would be a lot safer for Ireena.

Although he's never been to the abbey, Lucien clarifies our route to the best of his knowledge. We think if we leave now, we could possibly fit our whole trip in before the festival (assuming we don't have to spend a lot of time at the abbey or winery). We arrange board for the siblings at the church, go and collect Sir Carrots (giving a hard stare to Rictavio's wagon, which doesn't do anything weird) and head west out of town at speed.

We soon encounter a bridge, unusual in the fact that there's no creepy corpse on it. Just past the bridge we hit a crossroads. The four-way sign head of the signpost is broken off. We point the Vallaki arm the way we came (northeast), and look at the others. The sign says Krezk and Tsolenka Pass are to the southwest, Lake Baratok to the northwest, Vallaki and Ravenloft to the northeast, and Berez to the southeast.
