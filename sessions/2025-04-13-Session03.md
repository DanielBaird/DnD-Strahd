We take a short rest in the dusty bedroom, alongside the ghast corpses.

We find the stairs down to the chanting room. We get to understand the words: "He is the Ancient. He is the Land." Charity seems more and more excited and nervous. "Get ready. Get ready!" she hisses at the group.

The next room is empty but for thirteen alcoves, containing items collected by the cult:

- A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin's hand) on a loop of rope
- A knife carved from a human bone
- A dagger with a rat's skull set into the pommel
- An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothic's eye
- An aspergillum carved from bone
- A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin
- A desiccated frog lashed to a stick (could be mistaken for a wand of polymorph)
- A bag full of bat guano
- A hag's severed finger
- A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms crossed over its chest
- An iron pendant adorned with a devil's face
- The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling
- A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf's withered tongue

We head down a corridor that looks like the prison they would keep sacrifices. It's littered with bones and shackes on the walls. A single intact human skeleton in tattered black robes is chained to the far wall. It falls apart when we search it, and we find a gold ring.

> T: acquires gold ring, 25gp

The next corridor is blocked by a portcullis. Banhammer whirrs and clicks and hoists the heavy gate, and we head into the next cave.

The chanting stops. The floor is covered with water, and a octagonal dias rises above the water, topped by an altar, carved with ghouls, with chains descending to the altar from the ceiling. A raised walkway rings the room; on the other side of the room, the wall is dug out and a rubbish pile sits there.

Banhammer climbs the stairs to the altar, and the chanting rises again, coming from thirteen spectral figures who appear on the ringway, chanting "One Must Die!"

There's a fairly open discussion about whether evicting Charity's ghost might count as "killing", but when Aryn tries bagpiping the ghost out, the chanting stops and the garbage pile shambles to life as Lorgoth the Destroyer. Charity was getting nervous about the exorcism talk but the appearance of a big monster appears to cheer her up immensely.

Buffed by Thalion's blessing, we pile on. Banhammer takes a few swings to warm up but Thalion's blessing and Aryn's inspiring words help him break out of the slump.

The shambling mound is a tough opponent for our melee folk but with some healing and decent rolls we finally kill Lorgoth.

Lorgoth's death appears to count as *One has died*, and the chanting spectral figures disappear, and we hear an agonised scream in the distance. We rest briefly while the bot boys recover, then we climb back up the stairs from the altar room to the main underground level and check into the unexplored areas.

The family crypt coffins are empty, and etched with Gustav, Elisabeth, Rosavalda, Thornboldt, and Walter Durst. A sixth crypt is also empty but not named.

The remainder of the house seems quiet, and at Thalion's suggestion we troop through the house floors retrieving the children's bones and restoring them to their crypts. Rose's ghost finally leaves Charity, confirming everyone's suspicions.

However when we head back up into the house levels, it's changed. Every window is bricked up, every doorway is now slashing scythe blades, and a thick black smoke is billowing from the fireplaces. We hear noises of anguish and anger throughout the house.

From the basement we come out on the second floor, and looking down the stairs we can see that floor one is filled with black smoke. We rush down through floor one to the ground floor, most of us taking poison damage from the smoke.

We have to navigate two doors to get outside; the sound of a donkey outside is enough to convince Charity to dive through the slashing blades. She does okay but the rest of the crew take a lot of damage diving through the blades.

We make it outside, and creepy visions of Rose and Thorn wave at us from the windows of the clean, quiet house we see from the outside. These false apparitions are clearly created by the house to lure people in.

Sir Carrots is there awaiting us. Charity inspects the carrots she retrieved from the house; they no longer appear to be fresh and wholesome, so she drops the withered roots onto the dust of the road.

The wailing we hear is louder to the west, into the village, and we head that direction. We suspect there are real people living in the town, but we don't see anywhere we might feel welcome until we get to a town square and find a few public-ish buildings. To the north the *Blood on the Vine* tavern; to the south, *Bill Drass Mercantile*. We head for the tavern.
